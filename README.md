# Disaster.ai
Idea for Code.Fun.Do++
As we are all aware that the theme for this yearâ€™s code.fun.do is mainly based on natural
disasters, so we , Team Catastrophe have decided to work on one of the most fatal natural
disasters,Earthquake.

We have decided to create a software based device which is going to be a complete package
for dealing with Earthquakes, right from predictions to the analysis of the earthquake.
The device is mainly going to work in four domains:Prediction, Real time help, Relief,
Analysis.

1.Prediction:
First of all , it is important to analyze the impact of earthquakes on human life
and resources. Some 10,000 people die each year in earthquakes and aftermath.
We are going to take the help of Machine Learning and Neural Networks to optimize the
performance of predictor installed .Initially, we will train the model using data from a similar
experiment conducted by MIT, and move to real earthquake data as we move on. Apart from this,we will also have a Webapp with which we will collaborate with the eathquake detecting seismographic center and we will ceate a web server which will flash the realtime location of the centers on the website. If any center show sudden change map will show warning message on the web server. further we can send warning message to the nearest location which can be in threat.

2. Real time help:
Apart from predicting earthquakes, the device is also going to brief about the precaution
measures to be followed during the earthquake. We also seek to provide real time help to
anyone who is not sure what to do in case of a earthquake.

3.Relief:
Another major issue in case of earthquake is lack of proper relief. So, we plan to work on this.
The way we look to approach this problem is installation of a device or using cctv camera of the buildings or any
public place which with the help of Image Analysis can generate a real time data of who all were
present at the site of a collapse or any other damage, so proper relief measures can be
undertaken for those who have not yet been located.

4.Analysis:
Another important feature we look to work on is the analysis of analysis of earthquake. Analysis
is important because it can help us to deal with the next earthquake in a better way.
Another important thing we taken into consideration is that it is important for general public to be
informed about earthquake well in time. So we plan to collaborate with news channel, post on
social media channels so that everyone is informed well in time.
So that is all we look to offer and really hope that it can be helpful when earthquake strikes next.
Thank you.
Team Catastrophe
